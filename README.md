# team-profile-generator

This application uses JavaScript to create a Profile for a team consisting of a manager, engineers and interns. 
The code uses Node along with Inquirer and Jest dependencies (links shown in the package.json).
The user is prompted within the integrated terminal in VSC to answer a series of questions for each new team member
When the final team member is added, a HTML file is generated that displays the team members in a grid - manager first, then engineers, then interns.
